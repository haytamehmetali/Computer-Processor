## 💼 ComputerProcessor - Digital Design

ComputerProcessor is a digital design project implemented in VHDL, focusing on modeling fundamental CPU components and simulating the behavior of a small-scale computer system.


## 📌 Project Description

This project comprises a modular digital design of a basic processor and its core components, including the ALU, control unit, datapath, memory modules, and test benches for simulation. The repository serves as an educational demonstration of computer architecture principles using VHDL.
