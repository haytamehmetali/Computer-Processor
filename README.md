## ⚡ ComputerProcessor - Digital Design

ComputerProcessor is a digital design project implemented in VHDL, focusing on modeling fundamental CPU components and simulating the behavior of a small-scale computer system.


## 📌 Project Description

This project comprises a modular digital design of a basic processor and its core components, including the ALU, control unit, datapath, memory modules, and test benches for simulation. The repository serves as an educational demonstration of computer architecture principles using VHDL.


## 📚 Used Modules

 ⚙️ **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** - Implements arithmetic and logic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, bitwise operations)  
 🎛️ **Control Unit** - Generates control signals to orchestrate instruction execution across processor components  
 🖥️ **CPU / Datapath** - Integrates ALU, registers, and control logic to form the processing unit executing instructions  
 🕵️‍♂️ **Digital Tracking of Employee Activities** - Track shifts, logins, leaves, and more  
 🗂️ **Memory Units**    
     📖 **Program Memory:** Stores the instruction set     
     💾 **Data Memory:** Holds operational data and state     
 📤 **Output Ports** - Interfaces for outputting processor results or status  
 🖧  **Top-Level Computer** - Combines all modules to simulate a cohesive CPU system  
 🧪 **Testbench** - Provides simulation environment, verifying functionality of the overall system
